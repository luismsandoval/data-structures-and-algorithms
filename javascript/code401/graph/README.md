## Challenge 38

- write a function, `can_solve`, which takes a maze as its input and returns boolean `true` if a player could get from the start of the maze to the pot of gold, or false if there is a locked door without an available key between the start and the gold.

- Defining the input type of the can_solve function is part of this challenge.
