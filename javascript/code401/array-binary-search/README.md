# Binary Search of Sorted Array
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Write a function called `binarySearch` which takes in 2 parameters: a sorted array and the search key. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the index of the array’s element that is equal to the value of the search key, or -1 if the element is not in the array.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Discuss Why. What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

We wanted to be as efficient as possible, so we opted to search for our `key` using a binary search to minimize the steps needed to find our array index.
