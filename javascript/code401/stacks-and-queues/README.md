# Sets of Stacks

## Challenge

Implement a data structure SetOfStacks that should be composed of several stacks, and should create a new stack once the previous one exceeds capacity.  

## Approach & Efficiency

Test Driven Development. I started writing out some basic tests before writing the actual methods.
