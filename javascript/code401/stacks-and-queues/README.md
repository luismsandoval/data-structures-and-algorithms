# Stacks and Queues

Using a Linked List as the underlying data storage mechanism, implement both a _Stack_ and a _Queue_

## Challenge

<!-- Description of the challenge -->

### Stack

- `push()`

  - adds a new node with that value to the `top` of the stack with an O(1) Time performance.

- `pop()`

  - Removes the node from the top of the stack.
  - Returns the value from node at the top of the stack.

- `peek()`
  - Returns the value from node at the top of the stack.

### Queue

- `enqueue()`

  - adds a new node with that value to the back of the queue with an O(1) Time performance.

- `dequeue()`

  - Removes the node from the front of the queue.
  - Returns value from node from the front of the queue.

- `peek()`
  - Returns the value from node at the top of the stack.

## Approach & Efficiency

Test Driven Development. I started writing out some basic tests before writing the actual methods.
