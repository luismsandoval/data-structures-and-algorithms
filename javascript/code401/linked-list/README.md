# Singly Linked List

<!-- Short summary or background information -->

Here is a linked list using ES6 classes in TypeScript. The list contains a nodes which have an _item_, and _next_ properties which points to the next node.

## Challenge

<!-- Description of the challenge -->

Write a method that takes a number, `k` as a param, and returns the nodes _value_ that is `k` places frokm the end of the linked list.

## Approach & Efficiency

<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

This time around I tried to do some Test Driven Development. Since I now feel more comfortable writing tests, it was easier for me to start there.

Big O => O(n)
